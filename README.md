# xG_Analysis
The main point of the analysis was to find out whether there is a relationship between chances for scoring the goal (measured by expected goals indicator (xG)) and some statistics that describe team quality in defense and midfield (such as medium pass completion percentage, tackles and touches in defensive or middle third or progressive passes). This relationship was then used to create and evaluate several different models.

Data was scraped from [fbref.com](fbref.com).

Applied Machine-Learning algorithms:
- KNN (implemented from scratch),
- parametric Naive Bayes (implemented from scratch),
- non-parametric Naive Bayes (implemented from scratch),
- Decision Tree,
- Bagging using Decision Tree,
- AdaBoost using Decision Tree,
- Gradient Boosting,
- Neural Network.

Used Python modules:
- pandas,
- numpy,
- matplotlib,
- seaborn,
- scikit-learn,
- tensorflow,
- keras.
